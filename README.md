a fun little malware (if you can really call it that) inspired by the "You Are An Idiot" malware

This malware is an executable version of the "You Are An Idiot" malware upgraded with the face of the legend himself.
It's focus isn't that much to brick your pc, but rather to spam your screen with as much lovely faces, before doing so.
As such I'm trying to optimise it for CPU usage and such.

Not sure if I'd update it, it's here so I can easily show it to my friends.
