a fun little malware (if you can really call it that) inspired by the "You Are An Idiot" malware

This malware is an executable version of the "You Are An Idiot" malware upgraded with the face of the legend himself.
It's focus isn't that much to brick your pc, but rather to spam your screen with as much lovely faces, before doing so.
As such I'm trying to optimise it for CPU usage and such.
If you find anything you think can be improved (which is not GDI), you can write me a message. I don't encourage wasting your time with writing any code though!
